# cn-series-deploy
A set of Terraform plans for deploying a Kubernetes cluster protected by a Palo Alto Networks CN-Series Next-Generation Firewall.  Kubernetes environments supported include GKE, EKS, and AKS.

### Documentation
All documentation for the Terraform plans contained in this repository are located in the project wiki located [here](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/cn-series-deploy/wiki).

## Support

This template/solution is released under an as-is, best effort, support
policy. These scripts should be seen as community supported and Palo
Alto Networks will contribute our expertise as and when possible. We do
not provide technical support or help in using or troubleshooting the
components of the project through our normal support options such as
Palo Alto Networks support teams, or ASC (Authorized Support Centers)
partners and backline support options. The underlying product used (the
VM-Series firewall) by the scripts or templates are still supported, but
the support is only for the product functionality and not for help in
deploying or using the template or script itself.

Unless explicitly tagged, all projects or work posted in our GitHub
repository (at <https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks>) or sites other
than our official Downloads page on <https://support.paloaltonetworks.com>
are provided under the best effort policy.
